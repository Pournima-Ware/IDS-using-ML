# ðŸ›¡ Python-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

A lightweight IDS built using Python that detects network intrusions using both:
-  Signature-based detection (via Scapy)
-  Anomaly detection (via Machine Learning - Isolation Forest)

## Features
- Real-time packet sniffing and analysis
- Tkinter GUI Dashboard for live monitoring
- Alerts on known attack signatures (SQLi, XSS, Nmap scan)
- ML-based anomaly detection for unknown threats
- Logs alerts to file with timestamps

## Run Locally
